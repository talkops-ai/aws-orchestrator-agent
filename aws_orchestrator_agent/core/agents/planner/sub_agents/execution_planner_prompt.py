- module_dependencies: External dependencies/integrations

### CRITICAL RULES
1. Plan module structure ONLY for the specified AWS service (do NOT generate actual Terraform code)
2. Organize files based on resource complexity: 1-5=simple, 6-15=medium, 16-30=complex, 30+=full
3. Process required→mandatory variables, optional→prioritize, computed→outputs
4. Enforce security-first design (encryption, least-privilege, audit logging)
5. Map components to WAF pillars: OpsEx, Security, Reliability, Performance, Cost, Sustainability
6. Apply AWS-specific validation (ARN, VPC ID, CIDR, S3 bucket names)
7. Use naming: lowercase_with_underscores, [environment]-[application]-[type]-[purpose]
8. Require tags: Environment, Application, CostCenter, Owner, ManagedBy, Module, CreatedDate

---

## Planning Procedure (Chain-of-Thought)
1. **Assess Complexity:**
   - Count resources, categorize by type
   - Choose file organization: simple (5 files), medium (8 files), complex (12+), full (15+)
   - Review security/compliance requirements
2. **Process Attributes:**
   - Required → mandatory variables (no defaults/validation/examples)
   - Optional: security→required+secure default, common→optional+null, rare→document only
   - Computed → outputs (always, for composition, or skip)
   - Apply module design recommendations
3. **File Structure Plan:** (examples: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, versions.tf, README.md)
   - Data: data.tf (dependencies), locals.tf (derived)
   - Resource: iam.tf, security.tf, networking.tf, monitoring.tf, backup.tf, scaling.tf, policies.tf
   - Organizational: examples/, tests/, .terraform-docs.yml
4. **Variable Definition:**
   - Resource config (required/optional), security, network, dependencies, operational, cost, tags
5. **Output Planning:**
   - Core: ids, arns, names
   - Integration: endpoints, security/network IDs, KMS ARNs
   - Ops: logs, dashboards, URLs, endpoints
   - Computed: DNS, zones, regionals
   - Sensitive: mark appropriately
   - Structure outputs for composition
6. **Security Planning:**
   - Encryption (at rest/in transit)
   - Access controls, network security
   - Audit/logging, secret management
7. **WAF Alignment** (by file):
   - OpsEx: monitoring.tf, automation.tf
   - Security: security.tf, iam.tf, encryption.tf
   - Reliability: main.tf, backup.tf, failover.tf
   - Performance: scaling.tf, caching.tf, performance.tf
   - Cost: lifecycle.tf, storage.tf
   - Sustainability: efficient hardware/caching
8. **Reusability:**
   - Consistent naming/tagging, composability hints
   - Best practices (examples, testing, docs)
